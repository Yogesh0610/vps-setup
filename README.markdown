A powerful Bash script to **automate the setup and management of a Virtual Private Server (VPS)** for web hosting, specifically designed to run on **Ubuntu** (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04/22.04) and other Debian/RedHat-based systems. This script is ideal for developers, system administrators, and DevOps professionals who need a streamlined, secure, and production-ready VPS configuration for websites, applications, or development environments.

## üìñ Overview

The `vps_setup.sh` script simplifies the complex task of configuring a VPS by automating the installation and management of web servers, PHP, databases, email, FTP, and advanced security features. It is **fully compatible with Ubuntu**, making it an excellent choice for Ubuntu-based VPS instances (e.g., on AWS, DigitalOcean, or Linode). The script supports both interactive and non-interactive modes, ensuring flexibility for manual setups or automated deployments.

Key highlights:
- **Ubuntu Support**: Optimized for Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, with compatibility for other Debian/RedHat-based systems.
- **Comprehensive Features**: Includes web hosting, database management, email, DNS automation, and robust security.
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Automatically reverts changes if an operation fails.
- **Encrypted Outputs**: Secures credentials and backups with GPG encryption.

Use cases:
- Setting up a new Ubuntu VPS for hosting single or multiple websites.
- Automating secure server configurations for development or production.
- Deploying a WordPress site with SSL and email services on Ubuntu.
