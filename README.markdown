## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Debian-based (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04/22.04) or RedHat-based systems.
- **Root Access**: Must be run as root (`sudo`).
- **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading packages and dependencies.
- **Dependencies**: `bash`, `openssl`, `gpg` (installed automatically if missing).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yogesh0610/vps-setup.git
   cd vps-setup
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x vps_setup.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./vps_setup.sh
   ```

## Usage

The script supports both **interactive** and **non-interactive** modes, allowing flexibility for manual or automated setups.

### Interactive Mode
Run the script and follow the prompts to configure:
- Web server (Apache/Nginx)
- PHP version
- Database engine (MySQL/MariaDB)
- Domain setup with optional SSL, FTP, email, WordPress, and Cloudflare DNS
- Security features like 2FA, AppArmor, and Fail2ban

Example:
```bash
sudo ./vps_setup.sh
```

### Non-Interactive Mode
Create a configuration file at `/etc/vps_setup.conf` to predefine settings. Example configuration:
```bash
domain=example.com
web_server=nginx
php_version=8.4
non_interactive=true
enable_2fa=true
enable_wordpress=true
enable_cloudflare_dns=true
```

Run in non-interactive mode:
```bash
sudo ./vps_setup.sh --non-interactive
```

### Command-Line Options
```bash
--domain <domain>       Specify the domain name (e.g., example.com)
--web-server <server>   Choose web server (apache or nginx)
--php-version <version> Set PHP version (7.0 to 8.4)
--dry-run               Simulate actions without making changes
--non-interactive       Run without user prompts
--help                  Display help message
```

Example:
```bash
sudo ./vps_setup.sh --domain example.com --web-server apache --php-version 8.4
```

## Outputs

- **Logs**: All actions (success, errors, rollbacks) are logged to `/var/log/vps_setup.log`.
- **Credentials**: Stored encrypted in `/root/credentials.txt.gpg` with a passphrase in `/root/credentials.txt.pass`.
- **Report**: Setup summary saved to `/root/vps_setup_report.txt`.
- **Backups**: Encrypted backups stored in `/backups/<domain>/<timestamp>`.

## Security Features

- **Rollback Mechanism**: Automatically reverts changes (e.g., domain setup, user creation) if an operation fails.
- **Encryption**: Credentials and backups are encrypted using GPG.
- **Secure Permissions**: Sets restrictive permissions (e.g., 750 for directories, 640 for files) on web roots and backups.
- **2FA for SSH**: Optional Google Authenticator setup for enhanced SSH security.
- **AppArmor/SELinux**: Applies profiles to restrict Apache and MySQL processes (optional).
- **Fail2ban**: Monitors and bans malicious IPs targeting SSH, FTP, and web services.
- **UFW Firewall**: Configures rules to allow only necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443, 2222).

## Maintenance

- **Update the System**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
  ```
- **Check Logs**:
  ```bash
  cat /var/log/vps_setup.log
  ```
- **Renew SSL Certificates**:
  ```bash
  sudo certbot renew
  ```
- **View Credentials**:
  Decrypt credentials using the passphrase from `/root/credentials.txt.pass`:
  ```bash
  gpg -d /root/credentials.txt.gpg
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Issues**: Ensure the script runs as root and check file permissions in `/var/www`.
- **Git Errors**: If pushing to GitHub fails, verify your credentials or Personal Access Token.
- **Package Installation Failures**: Check internet connectivity and update package lists (`apt-get update`).
- **Rollback Failures**: Review `/var/log/vps_setup.log` for details on failed operations.
